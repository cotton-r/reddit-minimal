# Reddit Minimal

A lightweight, dark-mode Reddit clone using the Reddit API. This app gathers the top featured subreddits from Reddit and allows displays the trending posts in whatever subreddit you select. You can also use the searchbar at the top to filter results for posts containing a word or phrase. Comments can also be expanded for each post.

## Known Issues

Seems to randomly limit the amount of comments shown on each post. Videos do not have sound (this is due to the reddit API not supplying the sound with the video). 

## Enjoy!
